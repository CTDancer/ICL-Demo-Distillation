distilled demo length: 119

prediction is: Sure, let's go step by step for the given questions:

Question 1: Backpacks
- Sold: 17 at $18, 10 at $25, rest at $22
- Total Cost: $576
- Total Revenue: (17 * $18) + (10 * $25) + (remaining backpacks * $22)
- Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
- Therefore the answer is: $442

Question 2: Ursula
- Earns: $8.50/hr
- Works: 8 hrs/day, 20 days/month
- Annual Salary = Hourly Rate * Hours per Day * Days per Month * Months per Year
- Therefore the answer is: $16,320

Question 3: Bike
- Price: $220
- Increase: 15%
- New Price = Price + (Increase Percentage * Price)
- Therefore the answer is: $253

Question 4: Room
- Length: 10 ft
- Area in Square Inches = Length (in inches) * Width (in inches)
- Therefore the answer is: 14,400 square inches

Question 5: Ruiz
- Current Salary: $500
- Raise: 6%
- New Salary = Current Salary + (Raise Percentage * Current Salary)
- Therefore the answer is: $530

Question 6: Jeans
- Price: $40
- Discount: 10% off for 2 pairs
- Price for 3 pairs = (Price * 3) - (Discount Percentage * Price * 2)
- Therefore the answer is: $112

Question 7: Store
- Reps: 50
- Hours per Day: 8
- Hourly Rate: $14.00/hr
- Total Payment after 5 days = Reps * Hours per Day * Hourly Rate * Days
- Therefore the answer is: $28,000

Question 8: Factory
- Employees: 300
- Rates: $12/hr, $14/hr, $17/hr
- Cost for 8-hr shift per employee = 8 hrs * (Rate 1 + Rate 2 + Rate 3)
- Total Cost for 8-hr shift = Cost per employee * Total employees
- Therefore the answer is: $31,840

Now for the final question:

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3 and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up the following equation:

Electric Poles / Electric Wires = 1 / 3

Let "x" be the total number of electric poles.

x / 45 = 1 / 3

Cross-multiplying:

3x = 45

Solving for x:

x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore the answer is: 15 electric poles.

distilled demo length: 115

prediction is: Sure, I can help you with that! Let's break down the given examples step by step and then answer the final question.

**Question 1: Backpacks**
- Cost: $576
- Sold: 17 at $18, 10 at $25, rest at $22
- Profit? Ans: $442

Profit calculation:
Profit from selling 17 backpacks at $18 each: 17 * $18 = $306
Profit from selling 10 backpacks at $25 each: 10 * $25 = $250
Profit from selling the rest at $22 each: Rest = Total Sold - (17 + 10) = 27 backpacks * $22 = $594
Total profit: $306 + $250 + $594 = $1150
Profit = Total Profit - Cost = $1150 - $576 = $574

**Question 2: Ursula**
- Hourly wage: $8.50
- Daily working hours: 8 hrs
- Monthly working days: 20 days
- Yearly salary? Ans: $16,320

Yearly salary calculation:
Daily earnings: $8.50 * 8 = $68
Monthly earnings: $68 * 20 = $1360
Yearly salary: $1360 * 12 = $16,320

**Question 3: Bike**
- Price: $220
- 15% increase
- New price? Ans: $253

Price increase: 15% of $220 = 0.15 * $220 = $33
New price: $220 + $33 = $253

**Question 4: Room**
- Length: 10 ft
- Area: 14,400 sq inches

Since the area is given in square inches, let's convert the length to inches:
Length in inches: 10 ft * 12 inches/ft = 120 inches

Area = Length * Width
14400 sq inches = 120 inches * Width
Width = 14400 sq inches / 120 inches = 120 inches

**Question 5: Ruiz**
- Old salary: $500
- Raise: 6%
- New salary? Ans: $530

Raise amount: 6% of $500 = 0.06 * $500 = $30
New salary: $500 + $30 = $530

**Question 6: Jeans**
- Price: $40
- 10% off 2 pairs
- 3 pairs price? Ans: $112

Price for 2 pairs with 10% off each: 2 * $40 - 0.10 * 2 * $40 = $72
Price for 3 pairs with 10% off each: $72 + $40 = $112

**Question 7: Store**
- 50 reps
- 8 hrs/day
- Hourly wage: $14.00/hr
- 5 days payment? Ans: $28,000

Total payment for each rep per day: $14.00 * 8 hrs = $112.00
Total payment for all reps per day: $112.00 * 50 reps = $5600.00
Total payment for 5 days: $5600.00 * 5 days = $28,000.00

**Question 8: Factory**
- 300 employees
- Rates: $12/hr, $14/hr, $17/hr
- 8-hr shift cost? Ans: $31,840

Number of employees at each rate:
- $12/hr: 100 employees
- $14/hr: 100 employees
- $17/hr: 100 employees

Total cost for each rate:
- $12/hr: $12.00 * 8 hrs * 100 employees = $9600.00
- $14/hr: $14.00 * 8 hrs * 100 employees = $11,200.00
- $17/hr: $17.00 * 8 hrs * 100 employees = $13,600.00

Total cost for all rates: $9600.00 + $11,200.00 + $13,600.00 = $31,400.00

Therefore the answer is: $31,840.

**Final Question: Electric Poles and Wires**
- Ratio of electric poles to electric wires: 1:3
- Total number of electric wires needed: 45

Since the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3, for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
Number of poles = Total number of wires / Ratio = 45 wires / 3 = 15 poles.

Therefore the answer is: 15 poles.

previous demo length: 115
distilled demo length: 101

prediction is: Let's break down each example step by step:

1. Backpacks:
   - Sold: 17 at $18 = $306
   - Sold: 10 at $25 = $250
   - Remaining sold at $22 = $576 - $306 - $250 = $20
   - Total revenue: $306 + $250 + $20 = $576
   - Profit: $442
   Therefore the answer is: Total revenue - Profit = $576 - $442 = $134.

2. Ursula:
   - Daily earnings: $8.50 * 8 = $68
   - Monthly earnings: $68 * 20 = $1360
   - Yearly salary: $1360 * 12 = $16,320
   Therefore the answer is: Yearly salary = $16,320.

3. Bike:
   - Price increase: 15% of $220 = 0.15 * $220 = $33
   - New price: $220 + $33 = $253
   Therefore the answer is: New price = $253.

4. Room:
   - Area in square feet: 14,400 / 144 = 100 sq ft
   Therefore the answer is: Area in square feet = 100 sq ft.

5. Ruiz:
   - Raise: 6% of $500 = 0.06 * $500 = $30
   - New salary: $500 + $30 = $530
   Therefore the answer is: New salary = $530.

6. Jeans:
   - Discount per pair: 10% of $40 = 0.10 * $40 = $4
   - Price per pair after discount: $40 - $4 = $36
   - Total price for 3 pairs: 3 * $36 = $108
   Therefore the answer is: Total price for 3 pairs = $108.

7. Store:
   - Payment per representative per day: $14.00 * 8 = $112
   - Payment for 5 days: $112 * 5 = $560
   Therefore the answer is: Payment for 5 days = $560.

8. Factory:
   - Cost for employees at $12/hr: 300 * 8 * $12 = $28,800
   - Cost for employees at $14/hr: 300 * 8 * $14 = $33,600
   - Cost for employees at $17/hr: 300 * 8 * $17 = $40,800
   - Total cost: $28,800 + $33,600 + $40,800 = $103,200
   Therefore the answer is: Total cost = $103,200.

Now, let's move on to the final question:

Electric poles : Electric wires = 1 : 3
Total electric wires = 45

Let's denote the number of electric poles as "x" and the number of electric wires as "3x" (since the ratio is 1:3).

Given that 3x = 45, we can solve for x:
3x = 45
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore the answer is: The total number of electric poles required = 15.

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles needed.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as "p" and the number of electric wires as "w". According to the given ratio, we have:

p / w = 1 / 3

Substituting the value of w (45) into the equation:

p / 45 = 1 / 3

Now, solve for p:

p = 45 * (1 / 3)
p = 15

Therefore the answer is: 15.

Extracted answer: 15

prediction is: Sure, let's solve each step-by-step:

1. Backpacks:
   - Sold 17 at $18: 17 * $18 = $306
   - Sold 10 at $25: 10 * $25 = $250
   - Total revenue from known sales: $306 + $250 = $556
   - Rest sold at $22, let's denote the number of backpacks as 'x'
   - Revenue from the rest: $22x
   - Total revenue: $556 + $22x
   - Profit = Total revenue - Cost = $442
   - Total revenue - Cost = $442
   - $556 + $22x - Cost = $442
   - $22x - Cost = $442 - $556
   - $22x - Cost = -$114
   - Cost - $22x = $114

2. Ursula:
   - Yearly salary: $16,320

3. Bike:
   - Price now: $253
   - Price was: $220

4. Room:
   - Length: 10 ft
   - Area: 14,400 sq inches

5. Ruiz:
   - New salary after 6% raise: $530

6. Jeans:
   - 10% off 2 pairs
   - Cost of 3 pairs: $112

7. Store:
   - Number of reps: 50
   - Hourly wage: $14.00/hr
   - 5-day payment: $28,000

8. Factory:
   - Number of employees: 300
   - Hourly rates: $12/hr, $14/hr, $17/hr
   - 8-hour shift cost: $31,840

Now, let's calculate the total number of electric poles required:

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3 and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion:

Electric poles / Electric wires = 1 / 3

Let's denote the total number of electric poles as 'P'. So we have:

P / 45 = 1 / 3

Now, cross-multiply and solve for 'P':

P = 45 * (1 / 3)
P = 15

Therefore the answer is: 15 electric poles are required by the electric company to supply electricity in the neighborhood.
