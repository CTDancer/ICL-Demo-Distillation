previous demo length: 338

distilled demo length: 234

prediction is: Given the provided examples, it's clear that you want me to follow a step-by-step approach to solving the final question. Let's break down the problem:

Alicia's weekly dry-cleaning includes:
- 5 blouses at $5.00 each
- 2 pants at $8.00 each
- 1 skirt at $6.00

Now let's calculate the cost for each type of clothing:
- Cost for blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00
- Cost for pants: 2 pants * $8.00/pair = $16.00
- Cost for skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00

Add up the costs for each type of clothing:
Total cost for dry-cleaning in one week = $25.00 (blouses) + $16.00 (pants) + $6.00 (skirt) = $47.00

Now, Alicia wants to know the cost for dry-cleaning over 5 weeks. To find this, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks:
Total cost for 5 weeks = $47.00/week * 5 weeks = $235.00

Therefore the answer is: $235.00

Answer: Cost: $1,400

previous demo length: 234

distilled demo length: 159

prediction is: Sure, let's break down the given examples step by step:

1. **Movie Theater Loss:**
   - Capacity: 50 persons
   - Tickets sold: 24 tickets
   - Price per ticket: $8.00
   - Loss = (Capacity - Tickets sold) * Price per ticket
   - Loss = (50 - 24) * $8.00 = $208
   - Therefore the answer is: Loss: $208

2. **Total Cookies Baked:**
   - Number of church members: 100
   - Sheets of cookies: 10 sheets
   - Cookies per sheet: 16 cookies
   - Total cookies = Number of members * Sheets * Cookies per sheet
   - Total cookies = 100 * 10 * 16 = 16,000
   - Therefore the answer is: Total cookies: 16,000

3. **Original Word Count:**
   - New words learned daily: 10 words
   - Vocabulary increase: 50% over 2 years
   - Original word count = New words * 365 days/year * 2 years
   - Original word count = 10 * 365 * 2 = 7,300 words
   - Therefore the answer is: Original words: 7,300

4. **Movie Profit:**
   - Opening earnings: $120 million
   - Total earnings: 3.5 times opening earnings
   - Production deduction: 40%
   - Net share: 60%
   - Profit = Total earnings * Net share - Production deduction
   - Profit = ($120 million * 3.5 * 0.60) - (40% of $120 million)
   - Profit = $210 million * 0.60 - $48 million = $126 million - $48 million = $78 million
   - Therefore the answer is: Profit: $78 million

5. **Net Profit per Unit:**
   - Patch cost: $1.25 each
   - Selling price: $12.00 each
   - Net profit per unit = Selling price - Patch cost
   - Net profit per unit = $12.00 - $1.25 = $10.75
   - Therefore the answer is: Net profit per unit: $10.75

6. **Remaining Owed on House:**
   - House cost: $100,000
   - Down payment: 20%
   - Balance after down payment = House cost - Down payment
   - Balance = $100,000 - 20% of $100,000 = $100,000 - $20,000 = $80,000
   - Parents pay 30% of balance = 30% of $80,000 = $24,000
   - Remaining owed = Balance - Parent's payment
   - Remaining owed = $80,000 - $24,000 = $56,000
   - Therefore the answer is: Remaining owed: $56,000

7. **Material Needed for Craft Tablecloth and Napkins:**
   - Tablecloth area: 102 x 54 square inches
   - Napkin area (8 napkins): 8 x (6 x 7) square inches
   - Total material needed = Tablecloth area + Napkin area
   - Total material needed = (102 x 54) + 8 x (6 x 7) = 5,844 square inches
   - Therefore the answer is: Material needed: 5,844 square inches

8. **Cost of Discounted Australia Ticket:**
   - Original cost: $2000
   - Discount: 30%
   - Discounted cost = Original cost - (Discount percentage * Original cost)
   - Discounted cost = $2000 - (30% of $2000) = $2000 - $600 = $1400
   - Therefore the answer is: Cost: $1,400

9. **Alicia's Dry-Cleaning Expense:**
   - Blouses: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
   - Pants: 2 * $8.00 = $16.00
   - Skirt: 1 * $6.00 = $6.00
   - Total spent in a week = $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00
   - Total spent in 5 weeks = $47.00 * 5 = $235.00
   - Therefore the answer is: Total dry-cleaning expense in 5 weeks: $235.00
