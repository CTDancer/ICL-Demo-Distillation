prediction is: Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up the following proportion:

1/3 = x/45

Solving for x (the total number of electric poles), we get:

x = (1/3) * 45
x = 15

Therefore the answer is: The electric company would need a total of 15 electric poles to supply electricity in the neighborhood.

Extracted answer: 15

prediction is: Given:
Ratio of electric poles to electric wires = 1:3
Total number of electric wires needed = 45

Let's denote the number of electric poles as "x" and the number of electric wires as "3x" (since the ratio is 1:3).

According to the given information, we have the equation:
3x = 45

Now, solve for "x":
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore the answer is: The total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

prediction is: Let's break down the given information step by step:

1. The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3.
2. The total number of electric wires needed is 45.

We can use these two pieces of information to calculate the total number of electric poles needed.

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

To find the number of electric poles, we can set up a proportion:

1 electric pole / 3 electric wires = X electric poles / 45 electric wires

Cross-multiplying:

1 * 45 = 3 * X
45 = 3X

Now, solving for X (the number of electric poles):

X = 45 / 3
X = 15

Therefore the answer is: The electric company needs a total of 15 electric poles to supply electricity in the neighborhood.

prediction is: Given information:
- Ratio of electric poles to electric wires: 1:3
- Total number of electric wires needed: 45

To find out the total number of electric poles required, we can use the given ratio. Since the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, for every 3 electric wires, there is 1 electric pole.

Step 1: Calculate the number of sets of 3 electric wires (since the ratio is 1:3).
Number of sets = Total number of electric wires / Wires per set
Number of sets = 45 / 3
Number of sets = 15

Step 2: Calculate the total number of electric poles.
Total number of electric poles = Number of sets of wires
Total number of electric poles = 15

Therefore the answer is: The electric company would need a total of 15 electric poles to supply electricity in the neighborhood.

Given information: Ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45.

Let the number of electric poles be x.

Electric poles : Electric wires = 1 : 3

Therefore, x : 45 = 1 : 3

Cross-multiplying, we get:
3x = 45

Dividing both sides by 3:
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore the answer is: The electric company would need a total of 15 electric poles to supply electricity in the neighborhood.

Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires needed to connect and supply electricity is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the total number of electric poles required:

1. Calculate the number of electric poles:
   - Electric poles/electric wires ratio: 1:3
   - Total number of electric wires: 45
   - Number of electric poles = Total number of electric wires / Electric poles/electric wires ratio
   - Number of electric poles = 45 / (1/3)
   - Number of electric poles = 45 * 3
   - Number of electric poles = 135

Therefore the answer is: The electric company would need a total of 135 electric poles to supply electricity in the neighborhood.

Feel free to ask if you need further assistance or information.
prediction is: Given information:
- Ratio of electric poles to electric wires needed is 1:3.
- Total number of electric wires needed is 45.

Let's calculate the number of electric poles required step by step:

1. Calculate the number of electric poles per electric wire:
   Since the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, for every 3 electric wires, there is 1 electric pole.

2. Calculate the number of sets of 3 electric wires:
   Divide the total number of electric wires (45) by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 electric wires there are.

3. Calculate the total number of electric poles:
   The number of sets of 3 electric wires calculated in the previous step corresponds to the number of electric poles needed.

Now let's perform the calculations:

1. Electric poles per electric wire: 1 electric pole / 3 electric wires = 1/3 electric poles per wire.
2. Sets of 3 electric wires: 45 electric wires / 3 = 15 sets of 3 electric wires.
3. Total number of electric poles: 15 electric poles.

Therefore the answer is: The electric company would require a total of 15 electric poles to supply electricity in the neighborhood.

Extracted answer: 15

Now, let's move on to the question about the electric poles and wires:

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required.

The ratio of poles to wires is 1:3, which means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.

To find the number of poles, we can set up a proportion:
Number of poles / Number of wires = 1 / 3

Plugging in the number of wires (45):
Number of poles / 45 = 1 / 3

Solving for the number of poles:
Number of poles = (1 / 3) * 45
Number of poles = 15

Therefore the answer is: The electric company would need a total of 15 electric poles to supply electricity in the neighborhood.

Extracted answer: 15

   This example applies a discount to a ticket's original price to find the final cost.

Now, let's proceed to the final question:

The ratio of the electric poles and electric wires needed to connect and supply electricity in a certain neighborhood is 1:3. If the total number of electric wires needed to connect electricity in the neighborhood is 45, what is the total number of electric poles required by an electric company to supply electricity in the neighborhood?

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of electric poles.

Electric poles / Electric wires = 1 / 3

Let "x" be the total number of electric poles.

x / 45 = 1 / 3

Solving for "x":
x = 45 * (1 / 3)
x = 15

Therefore the answer is: The electric company needs a total of 15 electric poles to supply electricity in the neighborhood.

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires needed is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up the following proportion:

1 pole / 3 wires = X poles / 45 wires

To solve for X (the total number of electric poles required), we can cross-multiply and solve for X:

X = (1 pole / 3 wires) * 45 wires
X = 15 poles

Therefore the answer is: The electric company would need a total of 15 electric poles to supply electricity in the neighborhood.
