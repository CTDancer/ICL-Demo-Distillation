prediction is: Let's break down the information:

The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3.

Given that there are 45 electric wires, we can set up a proportion to find out the number of electric poles.

Let's say \( x \) is the number of electric poles required.

The proportion will be:

\[ \frac{electric \ poles}{electric \ wires} = \frac{x}{45} \]

Given the ratio is 1:3, this becomes:

\[ \frac{1}{3} = \frac{x}{45} \]

Now, cross-multiply:

3x = 45

To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ x = 15 \]

Therefore the answer is: 15 electric poles are required.

prediction is: Let's break down the information step by step:

Given information:
- Ratio of electric poles to electric wires: 1:3
- Total number of electric wires needed: 45

We know that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

To find the number of electric poles, we can set up a proportion using the given ratio and the total number of electric wires:

Number of electric poles / Number of electric wires = Ratio of electric poles to electric wires

Let's solve for the number of electric poles:

Number of electric poles / 45 = 1/3

Now, cross-multiply to solve for the number of electric poles:

Number of electric poles = (1/3) * 45
Number of electric poles = 15

Therefore the answer is: The total number of electric poles required by an electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

prediction is: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3.
2. We know that the total number of electric wires needed is 45.
3. Let's represent the number of electric poles as "x."
4. Since the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3, the number of electric wires is 3 times the number of electric poles: 3x.
5. We can set up an equation based on the given information: 3x = 45.
6. Now, solve for the number of electric poles (x): x = 45 / 3.
7. Calculate the value of x: x = 15.

Therefore the answer is: The total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires needed to supply electricity in the neighborhood is 1:3 and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, you can calculate the total number of electric poles required using this information. 

The ratio 1:3 means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. Therefore, you can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles (P) based on the number of electric wires (W):

1 / 3 = P / 45

Solving for P:

P = 1/3 * 45
P = 15

Therefore the answer is: The total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

prediction is: Let's break down the information provided step by step:

1. Theater Loss: Sold 24 tickets on Tuesday, resulting in $208 loss.
   Therefore the answer is: The loss per ticket is $208 / 24 = $8.67.

2. Church Charity: Church bakes 16,000 cookies for the homeless.
   Therefore the answer is: The number of cookies baked for each person is 16,000 / homeless count.

3. Tim's Learning: Tim learns 10 words/day, reaches 14,600 words in 2 years.
   Therefore the answer is: The total words learned by Tim per year is 10 words/day * 365 days/year, and in 2 years he learns 2 * (10 words/day * 365 days/year).

4. Movie Profit: New movie earns $120 million opening, with 3.5x return. After costs and cut, profit is $192 million.

7. Sewing Project: Sally's tablecloth and 8 napkins use 5,844 sq. inches of material.
   Therefore the answer is: The material used per tablecloth and napkin set is 5,844 sq. inches / (1 tablecloth + 8 napkins).

8. Travis' Ticket: Travis buys $2000 Australia ticket with 30% student discount, pays $1,400.
   Therefore the answer is: The total discount on the ticket is $2000 - $1400, and the original price of the ticket is $2000 / (1 - 30%).

Now let's move on to the final question:

The ratio of the electric poles and electric wires needed to connect and supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 1:3. If the total number of electric wires needed to connect the electricity in the neighborhood is 45, calculate the total number of electric poles required by an electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood.

Therefore the answer is: The total number of electric poles required is 45 / 3.
