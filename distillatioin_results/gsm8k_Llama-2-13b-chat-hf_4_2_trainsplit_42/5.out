prediction is: Let's break down the problem step by step:

Alicia's weekly drop-off includes:
- 5 blouses at $5.00 each
- 2 pants at $8.00 each
- 1 skirt at $6.00

Calculating the cost for each item:
- Cost of blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00
- Cost of pants: 2 pants * $8.00/pair = $16.00
- Cost of skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost for Alicia's weekly dry-cleaning drop-off:
Total cost = Cost of blouses + Cost of pants + Cost of skirt
Total cost = $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Since Alicia needs to send her clothes to the dry cleaners weekly, let's find out how much she spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks:
Total cost for 5 weeks = 5 weeks * $47.00/week
Total cost for 5 weeks = $235.00

Therefore the answer is: $235.00

prediction is: Let's break down the problem step by step:

Alicia's weekly drop-off includes:
- 5 blouses
- 2 pants
- 1 skirt

The dry-cleaning costs per item are:
- Blouse: $5.00
- Skirt: $6.00
- Pants: $8.00

Now, let's calculate the cost for each type of item:
- Cost for 5 blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00/blouse
- Cost for 2 pants: 2 pants * $8.00/pair of pants
- Cost for 1 skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00/skirt

Now add up these individual costs to get the total weekly cost for Alicia's dry-cleaning.

After finding the total weekly cost, we can multiply it by 5 weeks to get the total cost for 5 weeks.

Let's perform the calculations:

1. Cost for 5 blouses: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
2. Cost for 2 pants: 2 * $8.00 = $16.00
3. Cost for 1 skirt: 1 * $6.00 = $6.00

Total weekly cost: $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Total cost for 5 weeks: $47.00 * 5 = $235.00

Therefore the answer is: $235.00.

prediction is: Sure, let's break down the information and calculate the total cost step by step:

Alicia's weekly drop-off includes:
- 5 blouses
- 2 pants
- 1 skirt

Dry-cleaning costs:
- Blouse: $5.00 each
- Skirt: $6.00 each
- Pants: $8.00 per pair

Now let's calculate the cost for each type of clothing:
- Cost for 5 blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00
- Cost for 2 pants: 2 pants * $8.00/pair = $16.00
- Cost for 1 skirt: $6.00

Adding up the individual costs:
$25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00 per week

Therefore, Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning every week.

Now, to calculate the total cost for 5 weeks:
Total cost for 5 weeks = Weekly cost * Number of weeks
Total cost for 5 weeks = $47.00 * 5 = $235.00

Therefore the answer is: $235.00

prediction is: Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. Cost of dry-cleaning 5 blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00
2. Cost of dry-cleaning 2 pants: 2 pants * $8.00/pair of pants = $16.00
3. Cost of dry-cleaning 1 skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost for one week:

Total cost for one week = Cost of blouses + Cost of pants + Cost of skirt
Total cost for one week = $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Since Alicia goes to the dry cleaners weekly, we can now calculate her total spending over 5 weeks:

Total spending in 5 weeks = Total cost for one week * 5 weeks
Total spending in 5 weeks = $47.00 * 5 = $235.00

Therefore the answer is: $235.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost of Alicia's dry-cleaning for 1 week:

- 2 pants: 2 pants * $8.00/pair of pants = $16.00
- 1 skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00

Total cost for 1 week: $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Alicia spends $47.00 on dry-cleaning each week.

Now, to find out how much she spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks:
- Weekly cost: $47.00
- Number of weeks: 5

Total cost for 5 weeks: $47.00 * 5 = $235.00
