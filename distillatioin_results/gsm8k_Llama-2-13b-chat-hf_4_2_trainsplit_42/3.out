prediction is: Given examples show a pattern of providing information and calculations followed by the answer. Applying the same pattern to the final question:

Given: Ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3
Total electric wires needed: 45

Step 1: Set up the ratio equation.
Let the number of electric poles be "x" and the number of electric wires be "y". The ratio is given as 1:3, which can be expressed as:

x/y = 1/3

Step 2: Solve for the number of electric poles.
Since we're given the total number of electric wires (y = 45), we can substitute this into the ratio equation and solve for the number of electric poles (x):

x/45 = 1/3
x = (1/3) * 45
x = 15

Therefore the answer is: The total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

Given that the ratio of electric poles to wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion:

1 (pole) / 3 (wires) = X (poles) / 45 (wires)

Cross-multiplying:

1 * 45 = 3 * X
45 = 3X

Dividing both sides by 3:

X = 15

Therefore the answer is: The electric company needs a total of 15 electric poles to supply electricity in the neighborhood.

1/3 = x/45

Now, let's solve for x (the total number of electric poles):

x = (1/3) * 45

x = 15

Therefore the answer is: The electric company needs a total of 15 electric poles to supply electricity in the neighborhood.

distilled demo length: 88

prediction is: Let's break down the given examples step by step:

1. **Movie Theater:**
   - Seats: 50
   - Ticket price: $8
   - Tickets sold on Tuesday: 24
   - Loss: $208
   - Formula for loss: Loss = (Ticket price * Tickets sold) - Cost
   - Cost = $208 + (Ticket price * Tickets sold) = $208 + ($8 * 24) = $208 + $192 = $400
   - Loss = (Ticket price * Tickets sold) - Cost = ($8 * 24) - $400 = $192 - $400 = -$208

2. **Church:**
   - Members: 100
   - Cookies baked per member: 16,000 / 100 = 160 cookies per member

3. **Tim:**
   - Learning rate: 10 words/day
   - Time: 2 years = 2 * 365 days
   - Original words: 14,600
   - Knowledge increase: 50% = 0.5
   - Total words learned: Learning rate * Time = 10 * (2 * 365) = 7,300 words
   - Total words known: Original words + Total words learned = 14,600 + 7,300 = 21,900 words
   - Knowledge increase: Knowledge increase * Original words = 0.5 * 14,600 = 7,300 words
   - Total knowledge: Total words known + Knowledge increase = 21,900 + 7,300 = 29,200 words

4. **Movie:**
   - Opening: $120M
   - Production cost: $60M
   - Profit percentage: 60% = 0.6
   - Profit: Opening - Production cost = $120M - $60M = $60M
   - Total profit: Profit * Profit percentage = $60M * 0.6 = $36M
   - Total earnings: Opening + Total profit = $120M + $36M = $156M

5. **Sean:**
   - Patches bought: 100
   - Buying price per patch: $1.25
   - Selling price per patch: $12
   - Net profit per patch: Selling price - Buying price = $12 - $1.25 = $10.75
   - Total net profit: Net profit per patch * Patches bought = $10.75 * 100 = $1075

6. **Roger:**
   - House cost: $100,000
   - Down payment: 20% = $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000
   - Remaining cost: House cost - Down payment = $100,000 - $20,000 = $80,000
   - Parent's payment: 30% = $80,000 * 0.30 = $24,000
   - Owed amount: Remaining cost - Parent's payment = $80,000 - $24,000 = $56,000

7. **Sally:**
   - Tablecloth area: 102 * 54 = 5508 square inches
   - Napkins area: 8 * (6 * 7) = 336 square inches
   - Total material needed: Tablecloth area + Napkins area = 5508 + 336 = 5844 square inches

8. **Travis:**
   - Ticket cost: $2,000
   - Student discount: 30% = $2,000 * 0.30 = $600
   - Payment: Ticket cost - Student discount = $2,000 - $600 = $1,400

Now, for the final question:

**Electric Poles and Wires:**
- Ratio of poles to wires: 1:3
- Total electric wires: 45
- Let's assume the number of poles is "x".
- According to the ratio, the number of wires is 3 times the number of poles.
- So, the number of wires = 3 * Number of poles
- Given that the total number of wires is 45, we can set up the equation: 3 * Number of poles = 45
- Solving for the number of poles: Number of poles = 45 / 3 = 15

Therefore the answer is: The total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

prediction is: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The given ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3.
2. The total number of electric wires needed is 45.

To find the number of electric poles, we'll use the ratio and the given information:

3. Let's represent the number of electric poles as "P" and the number of electric wires as "W."
4. According to the ratio, we can set up the equation: P/W = 1/3.

Now we can plug in the given total number of electric wires:

5. P/45 = 1/3.

To solve for P (the total number of electric poles), we'll cross-multiply and then solve for P:

6. P = (1/3) * 45.
7. P = 15.

Therefore the answer is: The total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

prediction is: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Given ratio of electric poles to electric wires: 1:3
2. Total number of electric wires needed: 45

To find the total number of electric poles required, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio:

\( \frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3} \)

We know that the number of electric wires is 45. We can solve for the number of electric poles:

\( \frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \)

Cross-multiplying:

\( \text{Number of electric poles} = 45 \times \frac{1}{3} \)

\( \text{Number of electric poles} = 15 \)

Therefore the answer is: The total number of electric poles required by an electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.
